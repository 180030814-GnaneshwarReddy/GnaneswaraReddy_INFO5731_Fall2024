0,It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.,positive
1,"This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts). I think this is a good vender to buy your phone when budget is tight.",positive
2,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.  Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.",positive
3,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
4,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery. For a used phone that's a few years old I think this is excellent. It came boxed, with a charging cord and wall adapter.  Very impressed with the phone, the condition and the packing. I would buy from this seller again.",positive
5,"Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!",neutral
6,"The phone is great, there is a few scratches, none are actually visible except for one tiny one. The others are only visible if I flash a light onto my phone while it's turned off. The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation... I finally got the product today on Tuesday when they told me to come in this morning. It should never be this difficult to communicate with a customer in my opinion, but it is what it is. Good product, terrible delivery.",positive
7,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity). Overall, I've been happy with the performance so far, especially for the price. I would buy from MobileSupply again!",positive
8,"Very Unhappy. The level of battery does not match the high price of the second hand phone. You should inform this, but you didn’t.Without any kind of box.",positive
9,"Bueno lo compré el 09/03/2024 en un precio de 8400 aprox. Puedo decir que el celular sí que es original y cumple las expectativas. En estética para mí un 10, solo traía un raspón en la parte de abajo (no soy tan exigente porque pues siempre trae funda), en batería eh visto que les han llegado con entre 100% y 90%, tal vez fui de los salados porque me llegó con 83%, a la fecha (23/10/2024) tiene 82%, realmente no abajado mucho y si le eh dado buen uso. Lo único bueno fue que ya venía con mica de cristal, y el cargador básico que eran el cuadro y el cable (dudo que originales), pero se agradece. En fin, creo que a la fecha ya podría ser opción comprarlo nuevo (si no mal recuerdo lo vi en 12500). Para mi si que valió el riesgo, pero yo les recomendaría que si deciden arriesgarse vayan pero por su versión pro. Espero les sirva de algo.",neutral
10,"La verdad es la segunda vez que solicito iPhone reacondicionado y en esta ocasión por suerte me tocó recibir uno en excelente condición, la batería tiene una vida del 95% recomiendo este vendedor, la batería dura un día completo y lo cargo al 85% para conservar la vida útil del dispositivo, no tiene señales de que se haya utilizado tanto, es un buen equipo, siempre recomiendo comprar cargador originar para evitar problemas a futuro.",neutral
11,"Llevo desde finales de junio usando el teléfono y ha funcionado muy bien, me llegó el 82% de la batería solamente tres Rayones tenía cuando llegó uno de la cámara y dos en la pantalla fuera de eso funciona muy bien, la verdad es que recomiendo mucho comprar con este vendedor Muchas gracias por el producto.",neutral

55,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
56,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery. For a used phone that's a few years old I think this is excellent. It came boxed, with a charging cord and wall adapter.  Very impressed with the phone, the condition and the packing. I would buy from this seller again.",positive
57,"Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!",neutral
58,"The phone is great, there is a few scratches, none are actually visible except for one tiny one. The others are only visible if I flash a light onto my phone while it's turned off. The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation... I finally got the product today on Tuesday when they told me to come in this morning. It should never be this difficult to communicate with a customer in my opinion, but it is what it is.

59,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity). Overall, I've been happy with the performance so far, especially for the price. I would buy from MobileSupply again!",positive

Lo único bueno fue que ya venía con mica de cristal, y el cargador básico que eran el cuadro y el cable (dudo que originales), pero se agradece.

65,It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.,positive
66,"This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts).

67,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.

The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation... I finally got the product today on Tuesday when they told me to come in this morning. It should never be this difficult to communicate with a customer in my opinion, but it is what it is.

111,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity).

Lo único bueno fue que ya venía con mica de cristal, y el cargador básico que eran el cuadro y el cable (dudo que originales), pero se agradece.

117,It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.,positive
118,"This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts). I think this is a good vender to buy your phone when budget is tight.",positive
119,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.  Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.",positive
120,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
121,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery.

163,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity).

Lo único bueno fue que ya venía con mica de cristal, y el cargador básico que eran el cuadro y el cable (dudo que originales), pero se agradece. En fin, creo que a la fecha ya podría ser opción comprarlo nuevo (si no mal recuerdo lo vi en 12500).

169,It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.,positive
170,"This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts). I think this is a good vender to buy your phone when budget is tight.",positive
171,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.  Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.",positive
172,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
173,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery.

I would buy from this seller again.",positive
174,"Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!",neutral

221,It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.,positive
222,"This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts). I think this is a good vender to buy your phone when budget is tight.",positive
223,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.  Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.",positive
224,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
225,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery. For a used phone that's a few years old I think this is excellent. It came boxed, with a charging cord and wall adapter.  Very impressed with the phone, the condition and the packing. I would buy from this seller again.",positive
226,"Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!",neutral

On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday.

273,It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.,positive
274,"This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts). I think this is a good vender to buy your phone when budget is tight.",positive
275,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.  Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.",positive
276,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
277,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery. For a used phone that's a few years old I think this is excellent. It came boxed, with a charging cord and wall adapter.  Very impressed with the phone, the condition and the packing. I would buy from this seller again.",positive
278,"Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!",neutral
279,"The phone is great, there is a few scratches, none are actually visible except for one tiny one. The others are only visible if I flash a light onto my phone while it's turned off. The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation...

280,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity).

Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts). I think this is a good vender to buy your phone when budget is tight.",positive
327,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.  Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.",positive
328,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
329,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery. For a used phone that's a few years old I think this is excellent. It came boxed, with a charging cord and wall adapter.  Very impressed with the phone, the condition and the packing. I would buy from this seller again.",positive
330,"Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!",neutral
331,"The phone is great, there is a few scratches, none are actually visible except for one tiny one. The others are only visible if I flash a light onto my phone while it's turned off. The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation... I finally got the product today on Tuesday when they told me to come in this morning. It should never be this difficult to communicate with a customer in my opinion, but it is what it is.

332,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity).

380,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
381,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery. For a used phone that's a few years old I think this is excellent. It came boxed, with a charging cord and wall adapter.  Very impressed with the phone, the condition and the packing. I would buy from this seller again.",positive
382,"Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!",neutral

The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation... I finally got the product today on Tuesday when they told me to come in this morning. It should never be this difficult to communicate with a customer in my opinion, but it is what it is.

384,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity).

390,It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.,positive
391,"This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts).

If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.

435,"The phone is great, there is a few scratches, none are actually visible except for one tiny one. The others are only visible if I flash a light onto my phone while it's turned off. The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation... I finally got the product today on Tuesday when they told me to come in this morning. It should never be this difficult to communicate with a customer in my opinion, but it is what it is.

436,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity).

Lo único bueno fue que ya venía con mica de cristal, y el cargador básico que eran el cuadro y el cable (dudo que originales), pero se agradece.

442,It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.,positive
443,"This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts).

444,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.

445,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive

488,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity). Overall, I've been happy with the performance so far, especially for the price. I would buy from MobileSupply again!",positive

Lo único bueno fue que ya venía con mica de cristal, y el cargador básico que eran el cuadro y el cable (dudo que originales), pero se agradece. En fin, creo que a la fecha ya podría ser opción comprarlo nuevo (si no mal recuerdo lo vi en 12500).

494,It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.,positive
495,"This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts). I think this is a good vender to buy your phone when budget is tight.",positive
496,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.  Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.",positive
497,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
498,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery.

I would buy from this seller again.",positive
499,"Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!",neutral

546,It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.,positive
547,"This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts). I think this is a good vender to buy your phone when budget is tight.",positive
548,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.  Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.",positive
549,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
550,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery. For a used phone that's a few years old I think this is excellent. It came boxed, with a charging cord and wall adapter.  Very impressed with the phone, the condition and the packing. I would buy from this seller again.",positive
551,"Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!",neutral

On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday.

598,It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.,positive
599,"This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts). I think this is a good vender to buy your phone when budget is tight.",positive
600,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.  Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.",positive
601,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
602,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery. For a used phone that's a few years old I think this is excellent. It came boxed, with a charging cord and wall adapter.  Very impressed with the phone, the condition and the packing. I would buy from this seller again.",positive
603,"Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!",neutral
604,"The phone is great, there is a few scratches, none are actually visible except for one tiny one. The others are only visible if I flash a light onto my phone while it's turned off. The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation...

605,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity).

Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts). I think this is a good vender to buy your phone when budget is tight.",positive
652,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.  Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.",positive
653,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
654,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery. For a used phone that's a few years old I think this is excellent. It came boxed, with a charging cord and wall adapter.  Very impressed with the phone, the condition and the packing. I would buy from this seller again.",positive
655,"Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!",neutral
656,"The phone is great, there is a few scratches, none are actually visible except for one tiny one. The others are only visible if I flash a light onto my phone while it's turned off. The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation... I finally got the product today on Tuesday when they told me to come in this morning. It should never be this difficult to communicate with a customer in my opinion, but it is what it is.

657,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity).

705,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
706,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery. For a used phone that's a few years old I think this is excellent. It came boxed, with a charging cord and wall adapter.  Very impressed with the phone, the condition and the packing. I would buy from this seller again.",positive
707,"Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!",neutral
708,"The phone is great, there is a few scratches, none are actually visible except for one tiny one. The others are only visible if I flash a light onto my phone while it's turned off. The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation... I finally got the product today on Tuesday when they told me to come in this morning. It should never be this difficult to communicate with a customer in my opinion, but it is what it is.

709,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity). Overall, I've been happy with the performance so far, especially for the price. I would buy from MobileSupply again!",positive

Lo único bueno fue que ya venía con mica de cristal, y el cargador básico que eran el cuadro y el cable (dudo que originales), pero se agradece.

715,It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.,positive
716,"This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts).

717,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.

760,"The phone is great, there is a few scratches, none are actually visible except for one tiny one. The others are only visible if I flash a light onto my phone while it's turned off. The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation... I finally got the product today on Tuesday when they told me to come in this morning. It should never be this difficult to communicate with a customer in my opinion, but it is what it is.

761,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity).

Lo único bueno fue que ya venía con mica de cristal, y el cargador básico que eran el cuadro y el cable (dudo que originales), pero se agradece.

767,It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.,positive
768,"This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts). I think this is a good vender to buy your phone when budget is tight.",positive
769,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.

770,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive

813,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity). Overall, I've been happy with the performance so far, especially for the price. I would buy from MobileSupply again!",positive

Lo único bueno fue que ya venía con mica de cristal, y el cargador básico que eran el cuadro y el cable (dudo que originales), pero se agradece. En fin, creo que a la fecha ya podría ser opción comprarlo nuevo (si no mal recuerdo lo vi en 12500).

819,It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.,positive
820,"This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts). I think this is a good vender to buy your phone when budget is tight.",positive
821,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.  Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.",positive
822,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
823,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery. For a used phone that's a few years old I think this is excellent. It came boxed, with a charging cord and wall adapter.  Very impressed with the phone, the condition and the packing. I would buy from this seller again.",positive
824,"Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!",neutral
825,"The phone is great, there is a few scratches, none are actually visible except for one tiny one. The others are only visible if I flash a light onto my phone while it's turned off.

871,It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.,positive
872,"This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts). I think this is a good vender to buy your phone when budget is tight.",positive
873,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.  Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.",positive
874,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
875,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery. For a used phone that's a few years old I think this is excellent. It came boxed, with a charging cord and wall adapter.  Very impressed with the phone, the condition and the packing. I would buy from this seller again.",positive
876,"Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!",neutral

923,It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.,positive
924,"This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts). I think this is a good vender to buy your phone when budget is tight.",positive
925,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.  Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.",positive
926,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
927,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery. For a used phone that's a few years old I think this is excellent. It came boxed, with a charging cord and wall adapter.  Very impressed with the phone, the condition and the packing. I would buy from this seller again.",positive
928,"Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!",neutral
929,"The phone is great, there is a few scratches, none are actually visible except for one tiny one. The others are only visible if I flash a light onto my phone while it's turned off. The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation...

930,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity).

Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts). I think this is a good vender to buy your phone when budget is tight.",positive
977,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition.  If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.  Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.",positive
978,This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It’s fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!,positive
979,"Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery. For a used phone that's a few years old I think this is excellent. It came boxed, with a charging cord and wall adapter.  Very impressed with the phone, the condition and the packing. I would buy from this seller again.",positive
980,"Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!",neutral
981,"The phone is great, there is a few scratches, none are actually visible except for one tiny one. The others are only visible if I flash a light onto my phone while it's turned off. The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation... I finally got the product today on Tuesday when they told me to come in this morning. It should never be this difficult to communicate with a customer in my opinion, but it is what it is. Good product, terrible delivery.",positive
982,"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity). Overall, I've been happy with the performance so far, especially for the price. I would buy from MobileSupply again!",positive
983,"Very Unhappy. The level of battery does not match the high price of the second hand phone. You should inform this, but you didn’t.Without any kind of box.",positive
984,"Bueno lo compré el 09/03/2024 en un precio de 8400 aprox. Puedo decir que el celular sí que es original y cumple las expectativas. En estética para mí un 10, solo traía un raspón en la parte de abajo (no soy tan exigente porque pues siempre trae funda), en batería eh visto que les han llegado con entre 100% y 90%, tal vez fui de los salados porque me llegó con 83%, a la fecha (23/10/2024) tiene 82%, realmente no abajado mucho y si le eh dado buen uso. Lo único bueno fue que ya venía con mica de cristal, y el cargador básico que eran el cuadro y el cable (dudo que originales), pero se agradece. En fin, creo que a la fecha ya podría ser opción comprarlo nuevo (si no mal recuerdo lo vi en 12500). Para mi si que valió el riesgo, pero yo les recomendaría que si deciden arriesgarse vayan pero por su versión pro. Espero les sirva de algo.",neutral
985,"La verdad es la segunda vez que solicito iPhone reacondicionado y en esta ocasión por suerte me tocó recibir uno en excelente condición, la batería tiene una vida del 95% recomiendo este vendedor, la batería dura un día completo y lo cargo al 85% para conservar la vida útil del dispositivo, no tiene señales de que se haya utilizado tanto, es un buen equipo, siempre recomiendo comprar cargador originar para evitar problemas a futuro.",neutral
986,"Llevo desde finales de junio usando el teléfono y ha funcionado muy bien, me llegó el 82% de la batería solamente tres Rayones tenía cuando llegó uno de la cámara y dos en la pantalla fuera de eso funciona muy bien, la verdad es que recomiendo mucho comprar con este vendedor Muchas gracias por el producto.",neutral
